            Molly had been staring out of the her window for about an
            hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of
            <em>Nature</em>, <em>New Scientist</em> and all the scientific
            journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy
            of <em>On The Road</em> It had been Molly&rsquo;s favourite book
            since college, and the longer she spent in these
            four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.

            She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting
            under a poster with an Oscar Wilder quote proclaiming that
            <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do.</q>
